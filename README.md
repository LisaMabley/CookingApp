# Talkative Chef

Talkative Chef is an interactive recipe reader that makes getting and using
online recipes a fun and practical experience! Interact with online recipes
without having to get your device dirty or take your hands off your work.
Talkative Chef will walk you through the recipe so that you can focus on what's
in front of you.

Talkative Chef is a collaborative project created during the 3rd annual Hack the
Gap event. Hack the Gap is a two-day hackathon aimed at creating a high-energy
weekend where women from all backgrounds and experience levels can enjoy an
accessible, approachable, positive experience. Check out [Hack the Gap](
